Description of Class Diagram
    1. Main: The entry point of the program. It contains the main method, which parses command-line arguments and initializes the necessary components.
    2. LineCounter: Coordinates the counting of lines. Uses instances of FileProcessor and DirectoryProcessor to perform its tasks.
        - fileProcessor: An instance of FileProcessor used to count lines in a single file.
        - directoryProcessor: An instance of DirectoryProcessor used to find all .java files in a directory.
        - countLines(fileOrDir: File, mode: String): This method takes a file or directory and a mode (phy or loc) and returns the total number of lines based on the mode.
    3. FileProcessor: Handles the logic for counting lines in individual files.
        - countPhysicalLines(file: File): Counts the total number of lines in a file.
        - countLogicalLines(file: File): Counts the number of logical lines (ignoring comments and empty lines).
    4. DirectoryProcessor: Handles the logic for finding .java files within directories.
        - findJavaFiles(root: File): Finds all .java files starting from the root directory.
        - findJavaFilesRecursively(file: File, javaFiles: List<File>): A recursive helper method to find .java files.
